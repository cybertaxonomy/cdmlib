The project uses Maven2

 1) 
   * install maven 2.0x commandline tools locally (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
   * make sure Java JDK is installed (JRE is not enough)
   * Set in Eclipse preferences (not project) M2_REPO java class variable, pointing to your local repository. 
      - In OSX for example    /Users/USERNAME/.m2/repository 
      - In WinXP for example  C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.m2\repository
 
 2) checkout cdmParent as java project
 	* in cdmParent project root folder (together with pom.xml):
	   $ mvn compile
	   $ mvn eclipse:eclipse
 
 3) in cdmlib-model project root folder (together with pom.xml):
     $ mvn compile
