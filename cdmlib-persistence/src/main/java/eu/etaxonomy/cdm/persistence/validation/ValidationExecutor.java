/**
 * A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} specialized in dealing with
 * {@link EntityValidationThread}s and validation tasks (see
 * {@link EntityValidationTaskBase}). This implementation creates a thread pool
 * containing just one thread, meaning all validation tasks are run one after
 * another on that one thread. Especially for Level-3 validation tasks this is
 * probably exactly what you want. These tasks are run upon CRUD events, and you
 * don't want the database to be crawled to validate entire object graphs every
 * time a CRUD event takes place, especially since one CRUD operation may be
 * meant to cancel or correct a previous CRUD operation (e.g. a user of the
 * taxonomic editor may realize he/she did something wrong and then quickly
 * correct it).
 *
 * <p>
 * Although a {@code ValidationExecutor} sets up a thread pool containing just a
 * single thread, it does not logically or functionally <i>depend</i> on the
 * thread pool containing at most one thread. Thus, should performance become an
 * issue, and concurrency the solution, increasing the pool size is still an
 * option. For example, Level-2 validation tasks might be quite amenable to
 * being executed concurrently.
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason we extend {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} rather than simply use
 * {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor()} is that we need access to the
 * threads in the thread pool for the reason indicated above: if an entity
 * annotated with Level-2 or Level-3 validation constraints is updated, it will
 * be validated on the validation thread. However, if it is quickly thereafter
 * updated again, you really would like to terminate the first validation if
 * it's still running. After all, it doesn't make sense to validate an entity in
 * a state that it no longer has. For Level-2 validations this may not be so
 * important, because they are likely to run fast. But for Level-3 validations
 * you want to prevent needless queueing and execution of long-running tasks.
 * Thus, you really would like to know which entity is being validated on the
 * validation thread. The {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} provides a
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} method, passing us the thread and
 * the task that it is about to run. This allows us to track the threads in the
 * thread pool.
 * <p>
 * If the {@code ValidationExecutor} detects that a validation task enters the
 * task queue that will validate the same entity as the entity currently being
 * validated on the validation thread, it will call
 * {@link EntityValidationThread#setTerminationRequested(boolean)}. This gives
 * the {@link ConstraintValidator} running in the validation thread a chance to
 * terminate itself:<br>
 * <code>
 * if(Thread.currentThread() instanceof EntityValidationThread) {
 * 	EntityValidationThread evt = (EntityValidationThread) Thread.currentThread();
 * 	if(evt.isTerminationRequested()) {
 * 		// Stop with what I am doing
 * 	}
 * }
 * </code><br>
 * Constraint validators are free to include this logic or not. If they know
 * themselves to be short-lived it may not be worth it. But if they potentially
 * take a lot of time to complete, they can and and probably should include this
 * logic to prevent needless queueing and queue overruns. This would make them
 * dependent, though, on at least the {@link EntityValidationThread} class, so
 * there are some architectural issues here.
