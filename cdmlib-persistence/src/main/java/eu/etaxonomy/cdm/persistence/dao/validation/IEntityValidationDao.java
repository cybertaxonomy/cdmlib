/**
 * A DAO for accessing the error tables populated as a consequence of entity
 * validation errors. In general you can view errors from the perspective of the
 * constraints being violated, irrespective of the entities that violated them.
 * Or you can focus on the entities themselves, with all constraints they
 * violated. This interface provides the latter perspective while
 * {@link IEntityConstraintViolationDao} provides the former perspective.
 * Together these methods provide all persistency operations required internally
 * by the CVI (notably {@link EntityValidationTaskBase}s) and by clients. In
 * fact, strictly speaking implementors should override methods from the
 * superclass by throwing an exception. They should in any case not be exposed
 * via a service.
