Provides classes for data transfer of Data Access Object (DAO)
level classes via web services. 
<p>
Among real Data Transfer Objects (DTO) 
herein are also some classes which are helper datataypes like 
{@see IdentifiedString}, {@see TaggedText}, etc.
Apart from the DTOs which reproduce the DAO quite detailed this package 
contains fairly simple derivations. These transfer objects are referred 
to in the following as Simple Data Transfer Objects (SDTO).
<p>
The DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes are named according to the
following convention:
<ul>
  <li>Data Transfer Objects (DTO): {classname of the deduces DAO class}TO</li>
  <li>Simple Data Transfer Objects (SDTO): {classname of the deduces DAO class}STO</li>
</ul>
