What is the EDIT CDM Community Store?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A Central datastore for a community of users (taxonomically, geographically or otherwise defined). 
 The community store server is used to centrally host versionable CommonDataModel data. 
 The store makes use of the CdmLibrary and exposes webservices based on the CdmLibrary service layer. 

 Planned Services/APIs exposed by the community store are:
  * REST read operations for portals based on DTOs
  * RSS search feeds for subscriptions
  * Sync API, likely based on SyncML
  * OAI-PMH for aggregation
  * LSID resolver exposing objects in RDF as TDWG LSID voc
