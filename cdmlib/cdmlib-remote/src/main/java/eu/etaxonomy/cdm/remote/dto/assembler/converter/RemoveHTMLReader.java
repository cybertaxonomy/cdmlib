* A simple FilterReader that strips HTML tags out of a stream of characters.
* It isn't perfect: it doesn't know about <XMP> tags, for example, within
* which '<' and '>' aren't to be interpreted as tags.  It will also strip
* '<' and '>' characters (and anything in between) out of plain text files.
* For this reason, it should only be used with properly formatted HTML input.
