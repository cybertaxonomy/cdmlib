 * Implementors of this interface should to define in a private field the variable to be returned by the

 * The properties to be ignored should be initially skipped. This is done by returning the IgnoreList via the
 * {@link AbstractCdmBeanProcessor#getIgnorePropNames()}. The property can then be added again during the
 * {@link AbstractCdmBeanProcessor#processBeanSecondStep(Object, net.sf.json.JSONObject, net.sf.json.JsonConfig)}
 * where the return value of {@link #isReplaceMultilanguageText()} is evaluated.
