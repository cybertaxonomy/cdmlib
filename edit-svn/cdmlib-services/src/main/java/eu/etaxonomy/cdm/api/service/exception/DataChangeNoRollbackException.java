/**
 * Base class for all exceptions occurring during data change actions within the service layer.
 * NOTE: This exception needs to be thrown before any data is saved to the session as it rather forces 
 * commit then rollback. This is intended behavior to avoid full transaction rollback within longer
 * transactions. This way we do not need an explicit method to check if a data change method will
 * succeed or fail.<BR>
 * To avoid rollback the class on purpose does not inherit from RuntimeException
 * as RuntimeException leads to rollback when using {@link DefaultTransactionAttribute#rollbackOn(Throwable)}
 * which is used by spring as default transaction attribute.
